The Makefile will:

1) With 'make all' will make the modular base policy, load it and copy the
   configuration files to the correct directories under the "modular-test"
   policy area.

   The FLASK files are from F16 reference policy source.

2) To run the policy need to:
      edit the /etc/selinux/config file entries SELINUXTYPE=modular-test and
         SELINUX=permissive.
      touch /.autorelabel
      reboot the system

The "build-policy.py" build script should be read to find out the gory details.

When testing the policy capabilities or constraints example you only need
remove the comments from the relevant sections of the base.conf file and run:

   make  base_module

as this will rebuild the policy using just the selinux commands.
